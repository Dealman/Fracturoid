# Fracturoid

This is a little arcade game inspired by Asteroids among others, developed by Ev Amitay and its source was previously hosted on his website - http://evyatar.amitay.me/playground/blasteroids/ which is no longer available.

This game was also used as a minigame while waiting for matchmaking in a game called Fractured Space *(rest in peace)*.

I still had the source of this available and figured I'd post it here since his website has been down for a while. Not sure what license it was originally released under. So Ev if you read this by any chance - please let me know if you're okay with me hosting this and what kind of license you want it to be protected by. I'll of course remove it if you want me to!
